    "In the grid method, we split up the digits of each number and multiply them seperately, keeping track of the individual multiplications and the corresponding powers of ten. For this method we think of the numbers as strings, and perform single-digit multiplications using a table lookup. That is, we only multiply numbers using the \"memorized\" values of single digit multiplication, and thus our only computational task is to add up the products and distribute excesses to the correct powers of ten. (On paper we would use a grid to track the individual products, but this is not necessary in the algorithm.)\n",

    "This is called long multiplication, or the standard algorithm. A weakness of this method is that if we have two n-digit numbers, then the time to multiply them by long multiplication is $O(n^2)$; i.e., the number of operations required scales at about the rate of the square of the size of the numbers. For extremely large numbers this can become a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Karatsuba multiplication is a faster algorithm that requires $O(n^{\\log_2 3}) \\approx O(n^{1.585})$ operations. It achieves this speed increase by dividing the multiplication of two n-digit numbers into 3 multiplications involving numbers with less than n digits; then repeating that step on the three new multiplications, dividing them into multiplications involving even fewer digits, and so on, until finally we are only multiplying single-digit numbers. Because each step requires more addition/substraction operations than long multiplication, long multiplication is actually faster for small inputs. But for very large numbers (e.g. 1000 digits or more), the greatly reduced number of multiplications required ($n^{1.585}$ instead of $n^2$) makes Karatsuba multiplication much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the base step work? Suppose x and y are numbers specified as decimal strings of length n. Then let $m = \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$. We can write $x = x_1 10^m + x_0$ and $y = y_1 10^m + y_0$, where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are less than $10^m$. Then the product can be written\n",
    "\n",
    "$ xy = (x_1 10^m + x_0)(y_1 10^m + y_0) = (x_1 y_1) 10^{2m} + (x_0 y_1 + x_1 y_0) 10^{m} + x_0 y_0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the right-hand side as it's written above, we still need to do 4 multiplications involving $x_0, x_1, y_0, y_1$. However we can reduce this to 3 by writing the middle coefficient in terms of the other two:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_0 y_1 + x_1 y_0 = (x_0 - x_1)(y_1 - y_0) + x_1 y_1 + x_0 y_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we only have to do 3 multiplications involving shorter decimal strings, some additions/subtractions, and multiplications by powers of 10 (merely adding digits to the decimal strings). We can recursively compute the 3 multiplications, each time halving the lengths of the numbers being multiplied, resulting in a total number of multiplications of at most $n^{\\log_2 3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the procedure consists of the following steps:\n",
    "1. Write x, y as $x_1 10^m + x_0$ and $y_1 10^m + y_0$, such that $x_0, x_1, y_0, y_1$ are at most $m$ digits.\n",
    "2. Recursively compute the products $x_0 y_0$, $x_1 y_1$, and $(x_0 - x_1)(y_1 - y_0)$.\n",
    "3. Use these values and some addition/subtraction operations to compute the middle coefficient $x_0 y_1 + x_1 y_0$\n",
    "4. Finally use addition and multiplication by $10^m$ to compute $ (x_1 y_1) 10^{2m} + (x_0 y_1 + x_1 y_0) 10^{m} + x_0 y_0 = xy. $\n",

    "### 4. Fast Fourier Transform method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polynomial multiplication and convolution - why we use the Fourier transform\n",
    "\n",
    "When we multiply two base-10 numbers, we're essentially multiplying polynomials. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 105893 \\cdot 3819 = (3 \\cdot 10^0 + 9 \\cdot 10^1 + 8 \\cdot 10^2 + 5 \\cdot 10^3 + 0 \\cdot 10^4 + 1 \\cdot 10^5) \n",
    "\\cdot (9 \\cdot 10^0 + 1 \\cdot 10^1 8  + \\cdot 10^2 + 3 \\cdot 10^3) $\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the coefficients of the product, we have to take the two series of coefficients of the the original polynomials and compute their convolution. If the original coefficients are $a = \\{a_0, a_1, ... , a_{N-1}\\}$ and $b = \\{b_0, b_1, ... , b_{N-1}\\}$, then the convolution is the series $c = a \\ast b = \\{c_0, c_1, ... , c_{N-1}\\}$ where $c_k$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ c_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{n=k} a_{n} \\cdot b_{k-n} $\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "$c_0 = a_0 b_0$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$c_1 = a_0b_1 + a_1b_0$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_2 = a_0b_2 + a_1b_1 + a_2b_0$,\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. This requires computing about $N^2$ products in total. However, we can actually reduce the number of products we need to compute to just $N$ by applying the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The DFT maps our original series $a$ and $b$ to new series $\\mathcal{F}(a)$, $\\mathcal{F}(b)$. The exact definition isn't important right now; the key property is that the DFT converts convolutions into products:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{F}(a \\ast b)_k = \\mathcal{F}(a)_k \\cdot \\mathcal{F}(b)_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, instead of computing the convolution of $a$ and $b$ (requiring $N^2$ products) we can transform $a$ and $b$ into $\\mathcal{F}(a)$ and $\\mathcal{F}(b)$, compute the elementwise products of $\\mathcal{F}(a)$ and $\\mathcal{F}(b)$ (just $N$ products), and then invert the transformation to recover the coefficients $c$. As long as we can quickly compute the DFT $\\mathcal{F}$ (specifically, faster than O(N^2)), this will be faster than computing the convolution directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cooley-Tukey algorithm - a fast Fourier transform algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a series $x = \\{x_0, ... , x_{N-1}\\}$, the Discrete Fourier Transform is the series $X = \\mathcal{F}(x)$ where $X_k$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n \\cdot e^{- \\frac{2 \\pi i}{N} n k} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In general this requires computing about $N^2$ products of complex numbers - which is slow. Instead we will use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm called the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, which is $O(N \\log N)$ and only requires that $N$ be a power of 2 - which is not a problem for us, since we can simply pad the series with zeros until its length is a power of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental idea of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm is that we can compute the DFT of $x$ by computing, separately, the DFT of the sequence of even-indexed entries of $x$ and the sequence of odd-indexed entries of $x$. These sequences have half the length of the original sequence $x$. Hence, we convert the computation of a DFT on a sequence of length $N$ into two computations of DFTs on sequences of length $\\frac{N}{2}$. Since $N$ is a power of 2, we can repeat this recursively to end up with a computation of complexity $O(N \\log N)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in order to make this work, we must be able to combine the transformed even- and odd-indexed series back to the transform of the original series. This relies on a little bit of algebra:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    X_k &= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n \\cdot e^{- \\frac{2 \\pi i}{N} n k} \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we split the definition of $X_k$ into sums involving the even- and odd-indexed subsequences; then, we rearrange the exponents and remove a constant factor from the odd-indexed sum; finally, we observe that the resulting sums are just the entries $E_k$, $O_k$ of the transformed even- and odd-indexed sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second calculation allows us to compute $X_{k + \\frac{N}{2}}$ from $E_k$ and $O_k$:\n",
